#Palindrome Number

[leetcode problem link](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

This is a very ... high school problem.

I didn't do anything fancy, just convert int to string, and then revert the string to match each character. 

I could do a little more fancy by taking the module and compare the each digit, and it might be faster then reverting a string, but who cares, lol.
