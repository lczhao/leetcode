#Pascal's Triangle

[Leetcode problem link](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)

This problem is very intuitive, just print the pascal triangle.

I used python for this problem because I don't have to deal with vectors in C++, and it makes my life so much easier.

I used the math function (custom) nCr to compute the rows. 

I know there is a faster version by using recursion and compute from your previous row, but I used choose because it's the first thing that comes to my mind.
